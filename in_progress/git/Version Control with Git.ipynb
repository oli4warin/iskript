    "# Version Control with Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is a concept that you already know. All the modern Software is devolopped under **version control**. Even your operating system is developped under **version control**. But what is **version control** and why is it important for you? Let's first address the second part of this question. **Version control** in important for you, because it makes things easier when working with the computer. You basically use **version control** all the time when you work with **OneNote** or **Word** or a similar program. Whenever you make a change in these programs, the program stores the change and you get a newer version. Since all these changes are stored, you can easily go back to an older version of your project (Word file). You don't do this very often, and hopfully you don't have to. Because when you have to dig out an older version, it means that something went wrong. Most often this happens when you accidentally overwrite a document, or you delete multiple pages and save it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In software engeniering it happens very often that you make a change to you code, but later on you realize that the code was bad and you want to get back to the previous version. Therefore we need a way in software engeniering to explicitly tell which state of your project is a verison, so we can get back to it. Because there are many very small changes during the development - and many are just there to see if the code is still running - we need to specifically tell that these files in their current state are a version. It would be much to cumbersome to undo changes until you get to the point where you want to be, espacially since there are many bad versions on the way. This is where a **version control system** comes into play. This is essentially a software that keeps track of all changes we make inside a repository, whenever we tell it to update (create a new version)."

    "**Git** is such a **version control system**, and a very popular one. Most of the software you can find today is managed with **git**. **Git** is a so called *distributed version contol system (VCS)*, that means that many people can work on the same project at the same time, without being connected via the internet. It also means that you can work on your project on different computers, without running both at the same time, which is very nice.\n",

    "## Github\n",

    "**Github** is a hosting service for **git** projects. The two are often confused and the term **github** is often used instead of just **git**, which is due to the fact that almost all open source projects are hosted on **github**. But **github** is just the service that lets you easily share your projects with others, the real power still comes from **git** itself. But **github** is so usefull and very well integrated into almost all modern services, we are going to use is as well.\n",

When you press the `+` icon, you should see that your file is now under *Staged changes*. This is the *staging area* of **git**. Here we tell **git** what changes we want to include in the next commit. This seams a bit complicated, but the *staging area* allows us to ignore some changes from the next *commit*. If this is to complicated for now, you can always add all changes to the new *commit*.\n",

Good *commit messages* are very hard. If you don't know what you changed, you can always just put the word `update` in there.
