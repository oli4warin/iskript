    "\n",
    "- `range(start, stop)`:\n",

    "  counting from `start` and counts until `stop`, where `stop` is excluded. This\n",
    "  could be useful if you don't want to start from `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `range(start, stop, step)`:\n",
    "  This is very similar to the form with 2 parameters. The `range` function\n",
    "  starts counting from `start` and counts until `stop` (exclusively). In each\n",

    "  obviously very useful when you want to count in steps of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the step from of the `range` function here, because we want to access\n",
