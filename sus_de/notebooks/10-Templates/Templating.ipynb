    "Templates are very handy when we want to write websites that show different content but use the same layout. The same line of reasoning can also be applied to other documents like letters, exercise sheets, exams and other documents. The key observation here is that these documents all follow the same layout bat have a different content each time. If we only have to change a few small things we don't think about templating, but this is just because we think that templating is to difficult an time consuming to setup. This is not the case with **Jinja2** which is a templating engine written in *Python* and used in many different frameworks mostly for webpages. **Jinja2** is very flexible and can be used for all sorts of documents not just **HTML**.\n",

In the **Jinja2** example above we can see that we use `{{` and `}}` to indicate that we want the value of a variable at this place. This is very handy, because `{{` and `}}` don't occur very often in documents, so we can use it safely here. It also catches our eye, since is uses a lot of space on the screen. If we think in text and like a computer scientist, this line tells us that it wants to say something with the variable `name`. This is all we need to know, we don't have to know which greeting exactly should be shown here. This is a separation of tasks that occurs quite often in computer science and is a very practical tool to use.\n",
